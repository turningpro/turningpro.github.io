<h1>Welcome!</h1>

I created this site to learn GitHub and GitHub pages.  Seems in learning GitHub and GitHub pages, I am getting a bonus in learning  [Jekyll]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2023/10/21/welcome.html).

In creating this site, I have studied for eight hours in learning Jekyll and the basics of the Markdown language, BUT my main purpose of the site is to learn Python.

I am studying for the PCEP, but eventually I will do PCAP and PCPP.  I have ideas of what I want to do, but lack the knowledge and skills to do them. So I decided to learn and do what is necessary, so that I can build the applications that I have ideas for.
